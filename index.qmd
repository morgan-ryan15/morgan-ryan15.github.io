## About Me

I have an interest in cybersecurity and enjoy doing online labs to expand my knowledge. But I also can't help but have a passion for data, it's a great tool to be able to tell stories with.

Outside of the classroom, I'm a captain on the St. Olaf Volleyball team. I play libero, that person in the back row, in the different colored jersey, that's me! I love encouraging my teammates, celebrating our successes, and close games.
